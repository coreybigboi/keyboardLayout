# Purpose

I have to type a lot. This means that I want an efficient keyboard layout that is fun to use. 

# Layout

My keyboard is the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager), which has 52 keys. I try to use the top row as little as possible for MAXIMUM ERGONOMICS.

## 0. Base Layer

This layer contains all the expected stuff in QWERTY layout. There are some small changes such as Esc where CAPS normally is (shoutout Vim users). Other details are:

- Delete key is positioned closer to be more accessible.
- Home row mods on each side, where each finger is assigned a specific modifier (eg. shift on both index fingers).
- Modifier keys are also present on the thumb cluster as an alternative.
- Shift is placed on the large right thumb button to make typing shifted numbers on Layer 1 feel more intuitive, as Layer 1 is accessed through holding the large left thumb key.
- Function keys replace number keys on this layer as they are used less, which is why it's okay for them to be more than one row away from the home row. Having function keys on the base layer also makes actions such as Alt+F4 easier.

## 1. Numbers / Symbols Layer

All numbers / symbols live here. Symbols such as ! and @ are typed using shifted numbers. This keeps you on the home row and re-uses muscle memory from traditional keyboards. The motion for these symbols is holding down both large thumb keys. Some other details for this layer are:

- Symbols on the bottom row use the same finger for shifted / unshifted version of key on traditional keyboard: `-_`, `+=`, `|\`
- ` key uses same pinky movement as " and '.
- Bracket types all open and close with the same finger.

## 2. Navigation / Media Controls Layer
 
Arrow keys are placed in the same position as Vim motions movement. Home/End and PageUp/PageDown have also been placed to match the arrow key placement for less mental overhead.

## 3. Gaming Layer

Changes the keys to be more friendly for playing games.
