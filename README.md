# Purpose

I have to type a lot. This means that I want an efficient keyboard layout that is fun to use. 

# Layout

My keyboard is the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager), which has 52 keys. I try to use the top row as little as possible for MAXIMUM ERGONOMICS.

## 0. Base Layer

This layer contains all the expected stuff in QWERTY layout. There are some small changes such as Esc where CAPS normally is (shoutout Vim users).

## 1. Numbers / Symbols Layer

All numbers / symbols live here. Symbols such as ! and @ are typed using shifted numbers. This keeps you on the home row and re-uses muscle memory from traditional keyboards. Some other details are:

- Symbols on the bottom row use the same finger for shifted / unshifted version of key on traditional keyboard: `-_`, `+=`, `|\`
- ` key uses same pinky movement as " and '.
- Bracket types all open and close with the same finger.

## 2. Navigation / Media Controls Layer
 
Arrow keys are placed in the same position as Vim motions movement. Home/End and PageUp/PageDown have also been placed to match the arrow key placement for less mental overhead.

## 3. Gaming Layer

Changes the keys to be more friendly for playing games.
